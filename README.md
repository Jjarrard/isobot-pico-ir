# isobot-pico-ir
Translated from Arduino.

**This code does not work**, but if you want to try get it working on a pico and merge the fix, be my guest. I've wasted 4 days straight on it.

My only observation is that the overheads of MicroPython is slowing the IR cycles too much, and I've no idea how to fix it.

The Pico supposedly runs at 125MHz, but in testing it's been much much slower, to the tune of roughly 205588.8 Hz unless my testing was performed incorrectly (which is a high probability).
